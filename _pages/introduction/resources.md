We adapted this guide from the work of [GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/content-design), and thank their content team for championing plain language and information accessibility.

## Style guides

We generally follow [AP style](https://www.apstylebook.com/) unless otherwise noted. If there is a difference in addressing an item between the AP style and NASA style, use the NASA style. If there is a difference in addressing an item between the NASA Stylebook or Graphics Standards and this guide, use the Stylebook or Graphics Standards.

As we created this guide, we also referred to these resources:
