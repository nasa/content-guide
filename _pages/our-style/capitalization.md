title: Capitalization
---

Follow a consistent capitalization scheme.

Creating trustworthy internal and external communications relies, to a large extent, on the content’s consistency. Inconsistent spellings and capitalizations undermine your narrative authority. We follow these capitalization guidelines:

- Do capitalize proper nouns, including names of individuals, places, and agencies. For example:

> _Michelle Stanton, Ohio, Cleveland, The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA's Glenn Research Center, The Social Security Administration_ 
- Do not capitalize _agile,_ unless it is the first word of a sentence
- Do not capitalize _open source,_ unless it is the first word of a sentence
- Do not capitalize _federal_ or _government_, unless it is the first word in a sentence
- Do not capitalize the words _agency_ or _center_ unless used as part of the full name of an agency or center or another proper noun *(see the **Please note** section below)*

When you're deciding whether to capitalize noun phrases, keep in mind that in English, title case is often a marker of formality. Using it judiciously can help clarify that you're speaking about a specific, official thing (such as a form, office, or person). Implying formality where it doesn’t belong or exist, can cause cognitive stress to the reader. For instance:

- It makes sense to capitalize the phrase "Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return" because you want users to know the exact, official title of that specific form.
- It could confuse readers to capitalize _income taxes_ or _income tax forms_, because those phrases could refer to any number of possible forms.

See additional capitalization rules in the [Specific words and phrases](https://pages.18f.gov/content-guide/specific-words-and-phrases/)
section.

## Personal titles

Capitalize a personal title when it precedes a name. For example, *Director Lopez got the approval*. 

Do not capitalize a personal title that succeeds a name. For example, do not write *Lopez, the Director, got the approval*.

Do not capitalize a personal title when the word "the" appears in front of it. For example, *the director got the approval* or *the director, Lopez, got the approval*.

Whenever possible, keep titles gender neutral. For example, use *firefighter* instead of *fireman* and use *chairperson* instead of *chairman*.

## Headings

Headlines, page titles, subheads and similar content should follow sentence case, and should not include a trailing colon. For example:

> _Making sense of Washington’s tech landscape_  

> _Privileges and responsibilities_

## NASA's frequently used words 

For a listing of NASA's frequently used words that should or should not be capitalized, please refer to the excerpt taken from the NASA Procedural Requirements (NPR) 1450.10, Appendix H. [Capitalization](https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_1450_010D_&page_name=AppendixH).

**Please note**:
The NPR refers to NASA’s “Government” style, which we do not follow 100% for communication products or platforms, such as for a Glenn website. Two instances include the words "agency" and "center."

For example, using the NPR style for a written memo, one would write:
>_The Agency announced the new astronaut candidates for this year._ 

>_Our goal for the Center is to reach $425,000 for the Combined Federal Campaign._

But, the same sentence on a Glenn website would be written:

>_The agency announced the new astronaut candidates for this year._

>_Our goal for the center is to reach $425,000 for the Combined Federal Campaign._

 If you come across a capitalization difference between the NPR and the NASA Stylebook, always go with the [NASA Stylebook](http://communications.nasa.gov/sites/communications.nasa.gov/files/files/NASA%20Stylebook%20Rev%207%20-%20March%202017.docx) recommendation.
